Saif is a serial entrepreneur and builder with two successful exits.

As CTO at Bitstrapped (acquired by TELUS), he architected production AI solutions for hundreds of companies across IoT, fintech, healthcare and just about every other industry you think of being distrupted by AI. He also scaled the team from 5 to 100 engineers, and headlined Google NEXT speaking on production-grade agentic solutions.

As Chief Architect at Lemonaide (acquired by BeatStars), he designed scalable AI systems to responsibly serve the artist community.

Outside of tech, Saif runs a social enterprise working with communities in Madagascar, Kenya, and Brazil that has planted over 3.5 million mangrove trees and funded the removal of 45,000 kg of ocean-bound plastic from shorelines across Southeast Asia.
